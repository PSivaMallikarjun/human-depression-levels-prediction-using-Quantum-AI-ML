This project demonstrates the process of simulating a basic quantum circuit using Qiskit, a powerful open-source quantum computing framework. It includes the creation and simulation of a quantum circuit with two qubits, applying quantum gates (Hadamard and CNOT), performing measurements, and analyzing the results.
