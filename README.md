# human-depression-levels-prediction-using-Quantum-AI-ML
This project demonstrates the process of simulating a basic quantum circuit using Qiskit, a powerful open-source quantum computing framework. It includes the creation and simulation of a quantum circuit with two qubits, applying quantum gates (Hadamard and CNOT), performing measurements, and analyzing the results.

# Human Depression Levels Prediction using AI and ML

## Project Overview

This project aims to predict human depression levels, specifically focusing on depressive disorders, using artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and even quantum computing algorithms. The goal is to develop a system that can assess depression based on human faces and behaviors in public or isolated areas, with a focus on prevention and care.

## Key Features

- **AI & ML Models:** Used for predicting depression levels based on facial expressions and human actions.
- **Quantum Computing Algorithms:** Potentially used for enhancing predictions and optimizing the model.
- **Human Behavior Analysis:** Analyzing face and body language to detect depressive states in different environments (public and isolated).
- **Real-Time Data Processing:** Predicting and suggesting intervention strategies based on the detected depressive behaviors.
- **Prevention and Care:** The system will aim to provide preventive measures and care recommendations for users experiencing depression symptoms.

## Symptoms of Depression

Depression is characterized by a prolonged depressed mood, loss of interest in daily activities, and a range of physical and emotional symptoms such as:

- Sadness or irritability
- Loss of pleasure in activities
- Poor concentration
- Feelings of excessive guilt or hopelessness
- Disrupted sleep and changes in appetite
- Low energy levels

## Dataset and Tools Used

- **Data Collection:** Data will be collected from video footage or facial expressions using AI-powered algorithms to analyze faces and actions.
- **Pandas:** Used for data manipulation and analysis.
- **Python:** Programming language used for building the models and algorithms.
- **TensorFlow / Keras:** Libraries used for building machine learning models.
- **Quantum Computing Algorithms:** For exploring advanced predictions (if applicable).
- **Google Colab:** The project will be run and tested in a Jupyter notebook environment on Google Colab.

## Prerequisites

Before running the code, ensure that the following libraries are installed:
- pandas
- tensorflow
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- opencv-python
- quantum-computing libraries (if applicable)

Use the following commands to install necessary dependencies:

```bash
pip install pandas tensorflow scikit-learn matplotlib opencv-python
Project Files
ipynb Project Files: The primary project will be contained in a Jupyter notebook file (depression_detection.ipynb) where the model training, testing, and predictions will take place.
Data Files: Raw datasets or API-based data to be used for training the model (not included here).
Model Scripts: Python scripts for preprocessing, training, and evaluating the depression prediction models.
How to Run
Clone this repository or download the .ipynb file.
Open the file in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.
Ensure all required libraries are installed by running the pip install commands.
Run each code cell sequentially, ensuring data is preprocessed correctly, and the model is trained.
The final output will be predictions of human depression levels based on facial expression and actions analysis.
Expected Outcomes
Predicted Depression Levels: A numerical value or classification indicating the severity of depression.
Recommendations: Based on predictions, the system will suggest care plans or intervention strategies for people suffering from depression.
Real-Time Detection: The model will be able to analyze live data from faces or body actions in public spaces.
